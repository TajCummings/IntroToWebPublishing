# IntroToWebPublishing
Client Website for Trident tech - 

This repository contains the original code for a website that I created for Trident Technical College's "intrdouction to web publishing"
For this final project, I created a simple website for a local business in the Charleston Area 
This project is hosted on Free Hostia and could contain up to 500KB of data. This is the reason why it repeats photos and is lacking in some content.
I intend to work a bit on this to spruce it up as I learn more HTM/CSS but ultimately want to create a new site entirely to donate to the client.

Edit: This site is not longer accessible 4/17/2022
