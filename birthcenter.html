				<h3>Birth Center</h3>
				<p>The birth center is a health care facility for childbirth where care is provided in the midwifery and wellness model. This differs from a hospital in that your care is still primarily provided by a midwife, but in a formal area outside of the home. </p>
				<h4> Birth Center Pros</h4>
					<ul>
					     <li>A birth center may be a good option for you if you live with other people or in an apartment building with thin walls. Families determined to have a homebirth have solved these problems by borrowing a friend’s home for labor, or warning neighbors in advance of their homebirth plans. Your comfort is a key component in birthing success, however, so if you think you may feel self-conscious in labor a birth center can be a good option</li>
					     <br>
						<li>As most birth centers are within minutes of a hospital, a birth center can be a good option for people who would prefer a homebirth but live a long distance from a hospital and feel uncomfortable with the amount of time it would take to transport in case of that rare emergency.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Athough children usually do great at births, some mothers feel uncomfortable with laboring in front of, or even in the same building as their children. Birth centers are generally very supportive of children at birth, but are also a great option for natural birth outside of the home, and away from your kids.</li>
						<br>
						<li>There is often a higher rate of transport from birth centers than from homebirths, but Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs) who practice in birth centers usually have hospital privileges that make hospital transports smoother.</li>
						
					</ul>
				<h4>Birth Center Cons</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Birth centers run by a Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM) in most states are heavily influenced by the CNM’s supervising doctors and their protocol and prenatal testing requirements. This often leads to a higher rate of transfer out of the birth center practice during pregnancy or labor.</li>
						<li>While children are generally welcome at birth centers, most children are much more comfortable in their own homes. As well, they are easier to care for, especially in the event of a long labor.</li>
						<li>Families have to pack up and leave, commonly within hours of the birth. While this is a great benefit compared to hospitals that want to keep you for observation 24 to 48 hours or longer, it is far less comfortable and convenient than being in your home the whole time.</li>

				<h3>Fees</h3>
				<img src="image/familyintub.jpg" alt="baby in a sling fashioned scale">
				<h3>Costs associated</h3>
				<p>Homebirth is generally much less expensive than either hospital or birth center, as the “facility” is your home.When considering cost, keep in mind that additional services may be recommended or required by the birth center or homebirth midwife, but not included as part of the primary fee. Examples include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Doctor visits</li>
					<li>Lab work</li>
					<li>Prenatal testing</li>
					<li>Ultrasounds </li>
