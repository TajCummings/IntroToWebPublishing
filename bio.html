				<h3>Biography</h3>
				<p>Nicole M. Lavallee, LM, CPM has taught and supported women in childbirth since 1992. She was certified as a Bradley Childbirth Educator in 1993, then as a labor assistant in 1998 through ALACE, and as an EMT in 2001. Nicole was trained under a traditional apprenticeship model. She is currently certified as a Licensed Midwife through SC DHEC, and a Certified Professional Midwife through the North American Registry of Midwives. She is also former Assistant Director of Jamaica Birth, an educational program committed to providing birth practitioners with a comprehensive variety of clinical experiences. Nicole has three homebirthed children and was privileged to be present for the hospital birth of her adopted daughter. She has attended births as midwife, apprentice, birth assistant and labor support in homes and in United States and Caribbean hospitals over the years</p>
				 
				<p>Clinical care is provided by Nicole Lavallee, LM, CPM in accordance with SC DHEC regulations.</p>
				<p>Regarding her philosophy, Nicole says, "The foundation of my practice is parental education and informed consent. Whereas most hospital-based practitioners dictate their patients' care, I feel there are too many important decisions to be made in which there are no clear 'best choices.' Many tests, procedures and interventions fall under this category. It is important to me that expectant parents are full participants in decisions regarding their care.</p>

				<h3>From Nicole...</h3>
				<p><i>"My goal is to build a bond of mutual trust and respect prior to the onset of labor. The only things I expect of all my clients are: good nutrition, conscientious exercise, continued education, that they will breastfeed and that they recognize my need to comply with SC laws and regulations in my practice of midwifery."</i><p>
