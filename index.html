				<h3>Welcome</h3>
				<p>Pregnancy is a special time in a parent and family's life. Coastal Birth Services is here to help you explore all the options that will contribute to a healthy pregnancy and safe birth. Our belief that our bodies were made to give birth naturally is the basis of our commitment to facilitating exceptional birth experiences for parents and families. We do not shy away from, and encourage, the home birthing experience for all parents including those who are looking for a Vaginal Birth after Cesarean (VBAC) and parents of multiple income levels</p>

				<p>You can find us assisting the delivery of life in Coastal South Carolina, providing homebirth-oriented midwifery care from Myrtle Beach, Charleston and Summerville to Beaufort and Hilton Head.</p>
				
				<p>
				Beginning with a foundation of consumer-based childbirth education and including doula services and waterbirth/homebirth with a SC Licensed Midwife, Coastal Birth Services is able to provide a wide range of assistance to the expectant family. You may find more information on our services throughout the site. We highly recommend starting your research with a 2005 study published in the British Medical Journal: <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/330/7505/1416.full?ehom=" target="_blank">"Outcomes of planned home births with certified professional midwives: large prospective study in North America". </a>
				</p>

				<h4>Coastal Birth Services' Mission Statement:<h4>
