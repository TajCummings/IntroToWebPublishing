			<h3>Childbirth Education</h3>
			<p>Educational programs are the foundation on which our organization was built. We offer a variety of education programs tailored to expectant parents and aspiring professionals </p>



			<p>There is no more important resource for expectant families than a sound knowledge of the many ways to stay healthy and low-risk during pregnancy and birth. Education is a key component to being a wise consumer in the childbearing cycle. Whether you are planning a hospital delivery, birth center birth, or a homebirth with or without a midwife, Coastal Birth Services teachers offer classes that fit your needs and your schedule. </p>

			<h4>Partner delivery Preparation</h4>
			<p>Although we encourage all families to arrange for appropriate birth attendants, we recognize that there are families in our community who choose to plan unassisted homebirths. Because of our commitment to keeping expectant mothers and babies healthy, we feel it is important that these families have access to prenatal care and educational opportunities. Contact Coastal Birth Services for more information.</p>

			<h4>Health Disparity</h4>
			<p> Also important to our organization is Maternal Mortality. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm" target="_blank" > Maternal Mortality </a> is defined the death of a Mother within a year , before and after, of giving birth. South Carolina department of health and statistics tells us that The South Carolina maternal mortality rate is approximately 24 per 100,000 live births and is significantly higher among black women than white women (41.9 vs. 14.9 per 100,000). We believe that education and empowering women to make informed choices about their pregnancies can help to lower these numbers and save lives! </p>
