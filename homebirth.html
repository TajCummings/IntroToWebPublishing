				<h3>Homebirth</h3>
				<p>In an age of rising C-section rates, dangerous hospital infections, and increasing newborn and maternal mortality rates, expecting families are seeking alternatives to traditional hospital birth. The two main alternatives to hospital birth are birth centers and homebirth.</p>
				<p><a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/330/7505/1416?ehom" target="_blank">Studies</a> have repeatedly shown that homebirth for low-risk mothers with an experienced practitioner results in better outcomes for mother and baby. A licensed midwife can create a secure and reassuring atmosphere for a peaceful birth setting. The advisability of homebirth is discussed with the parents and considered on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with other appropriate health care providers.</p>
			
				<h4>Homebirth Pros</h4>
					<ul>
						<li> The continuum of being in labor, giving birth, and snuggling down with your newborn baby in your own environment creates an incredibly peaceful event.</li>
						<li> Your midwife comes to you. She is a guest in your home, so you are more in control of your environment, and ultimately your birth</li>
						<li> Your children feel very welcome at a homebirth. They are comfortable because they are in their own environment, and it is easy for them to “take a break from the action” by going to their own rooms to play or sleep. Families who share birth with their children report improved bonding and less incidence of sibling rivalry.</li>
						<li>Labor is Hard! Avoiding drugs is much easier when:<br>
						A. There aren’t any immediately available, <br>
						B. You aren’t hooked up to an IV, monitors and blood pressure cuffs, and <br>
						C. you’re in your own environment where you feel free to sing, yell, cry or laugh as loud as you want, walk around totally naked, smell your own home’s smells, and eat your own food. </li>
					</ul>
				<h4> Homebirth Cons</h4>	
					<ul>
						<li>Although many homebirth midwives have very low transport rate, if it happens to you, it’s 100%. In reality it does occur, and hospitals and doctors may be hostile towards people who attempt homebirth. The midwife generally receives the brunt of the criticism, but some of it can spill over to the birthing family. </li>
						<li>In our society, a family must be prepared take responsibility for the outcome of their homebirth. Seldom will you hear someone say, “That would have never happened if they were at home!” in response to a bad outcome at the hospital. Unfortunately, even if a problem at a homebirth is due to something like an unavoidable genetic defect, people will say, “That would have never happened at the hospital!” </li>
